## Overview

LumenTrace is a smart tool designed to monitor UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) status and manage Wake-on-LAN (WOL) for your devices during power outages. With a clean, modern web interface, it provides real-time visibility into essential UPS metrics like battery level and load, and lets you configure devices to automatically power back on when electricity is restored.

LumenTrace goes beyond simple WOL automation. It intelligently tracks which devices were online at the time of the outage and retains this dataâ€”even if the LumenTrace host itself loses power and reboots. Once power is restored and all monitored UPS units are back online with batteries charged to your defined threshold (default: 80%), LumenTrace automatically sends WOL packets to bring those devices back up. This ensures a smooth and reliable recovery after power loss, regardless of whether the LumenTrace system remained powered throughout the event.

Inspired by the original [wolnut](https://github.com/hardwarehaven/wolnut) project.
